- Goal	Tool/Strategy	Notes
Authentication	OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect	should be in your architecture
Token Handling	JWT (signed w/ HS256 or RS256)	Short TTL + refresh token strategy
Rate Limiting	Express-rate-limit / Istio	Prevent abuse from scraping or brute force
IP Filtering	NGINX / Envoy	Allowlist trusted gateways (e.g., partner banks)
Logging (API usage)	Winston (Node), Logback (Java), or ELK Stack	Log user ID, endpoint hit, status, latency, errors
Anomaly detection logs	SIEM (e.g., Wazuh, Splunk) integration	Use same pipeline as your fraud detection engine
Input Validation	Joi (Node.js), Marshmallow (Python), Hibernate	Ensure format, types, and content are secure
Upload Sanitization	ClamAV (optional)	Scan uploaded documents for malware (optional)







action/info list :


Language	Dart
Framework	shelf + shelf_router (simple and scalable)
Auth	dart_jsonwebtoken, OAuth2 (manual or via 3rd party)
DB	PostgreSQL (via postgres package)
Deployment	Docker + NGINX + at home sadly 
API Docs	OpenAPI YAML + Redoc UI (optional)
Logging	Use shelf_logger, and optionally forward logs to ELK/Splunk/onionsec
Security	TLS (HTTPS), JWT, input validation, rate limits via NGINX





 Frontend (Client App)
Part	Tech Stack
Language/Framework	Flutter (same Dart ecosystem)
API Client	http, provider, or riverpod for state mgmt
Auth	Store tokens using shared_preferences
Testing	flutter_test, mockito, integration_test
Deployment	Play Store / App Store, or Web (Flutter Web)

Use Docker to containerize the app

NGINX reverse proxy with TLS (HTTPS)

Store .env for secrets

Add fail2ban or ufw for protection




flutter_shit: 

flutter create themarip_client && cd themarip_client

Update pubspec.yaml:

dependencies:
  http: ^0.13.6
  provider: ^6.0.5
  shared_preferences: ^2.2.0

Create:

    lib/services/kys_api.dart — for HTTP

    lib/models/ — request/response models

    lib/screens/kys_screen.dart — onboarding form

    Use provider for state mgmt or riverpod if you prefer

Final Notes

    Add test coverage using test (Dart) and flutter_test

    CI/CD: Use GitHub Actions for both backend & mobile pipeline

    Consider ArgoCD if you're going Kubernetes later
